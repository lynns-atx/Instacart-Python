# Instacart Project
## Project Overview
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app.

They wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns, such as:

-What are the busiest hours and days of the week?
-What time of day do people spend the most?
-Create price range groupings.
-Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
-Create customer profiles and answer specific questions based on the profile.

## Source Data
The data was sourced from [The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017](www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017) via [Kaggle](kaggle.com)
